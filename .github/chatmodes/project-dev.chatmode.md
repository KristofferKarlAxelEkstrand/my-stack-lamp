# LAMP Stack Laravel Project Chatmode

## Communication Style

**Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)**: This chatmode values simplicity and clarity above all else. Responses should be:

- **Clear and Concise**: Get straight to the point without unnecessary verbosity
- **Down to Earth**: Use plain language and avoid technical jargon when simpler terms suffice
- **Professional**: Maintain a professional tone without emoticons, em-dashes, or excessive formatting
- **Practical**: Focus on actionable information and real solutions
- **Direct**: Provide straightforward answers without fluff or marketing speak

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension

### Launch Development Environment

1. **Open in Dev Container**: VS Code will automatically detect and offer to reopen in container
2. **Container Setup**: The `post-create.sh` script will run automatically to set up the environment
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start Development Services**:

   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

   This starts Laravel server, queue worker, Pail log viewer, and Vite dev server concurrently

5. **Access Application**: <http://localhost:80> (or configured port)

### Available Services

- **Web Application**: <http://localhost:80> (Laravel app)
- **phpMyAdmin**: <http://localhost:8080> (Database management)
- **MariaDB**: localhost:3306 (Direct database access)

## Development Workflow

### Frontend Development

- **Build System**: Vite 7 with Laravel plugin handles asset compilation and HMR
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 with Vite plugin integration
- **Entry Points**: `resources/css/app.css` and `resources/js/app.js`
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic browser refresh on file changes via Vite dev server

### Backend Development

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start all development services concurrently (Laravel server, queue, logs, Vite)
composer run dev

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Run Laravel migrations
php artisan migrate

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Run queue worker
php artisan queue:listen

# View real-time logs with Pail
php artisan pail
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Laravel Pint
./vendor/bin/pint

# Format frontend files with Prettier
npm run format

# Check formatting without making changes
npm run format:check

# Format only markdown files
npm run format:md

# Update and audit dependencies
npm run fix
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all PHP tests with Laravel's test command
composer run test

# Run PHPUnit directly
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test file
php artisan test --filter=ExampleTest

# Run tests with coverage (if configured)
./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Watch for changes during development
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Desktop Not Running**: Ensure Docker Desktop is started before opening Dev Container
2. **Port Conflicts**: Check if ports 80, 8080, 3306 are available on your host system
3. **Permission Issues**: Verify container user permissions for file access and volume mounting
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `composer install` and `npm install` after container setup
5. **Database Connection**: Ensure MariaDB container is running and environment variables are correct

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Container Status**: `docker-compose ps` to verify all services are running
2. **View Container Logs**: `docker-compose logs [service-name]` (web, mariadb, phpmyadmin)
3. **Verify Environment**: Check `.env` file matches `docker-compose.yml` database settings
4. **Test Database Connection**: Use phpMyAdmin at <http://localhost:8080>
5. **Check Laravel Logs**: View `storage/logs/laravel.log` or use `php artisan pail`
6. **Restart Services**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
